This Repository will contain work on several types of work:

It will have generalized functions and scripts that can be used for work in call center
forecasting and capacity modeling.  I will endeavor to have these general enough that
they may be used to solve the same problem under different data conditions.

It will also contain scripts which I will use for Kaggle competitions.  These will not 
likely have the same focus on generalization, however, I will endeavor to make the 
notes strong enough that users will be aware of code strength and weaknesses should they
decide to use or modify my scripting.

Finally, it will contain scripting for the John Malcom The Brave Project.  The scope of
the piece I am participating in is the calculations in the background.  Others will work
on tying in API and UI scripting.

Please use at your own risk and let me know if you have any suggestions.

***I've noticed that other documents in github are written in md, likely to add formatting.
This document will be revised as a .md in the future.***
